Medieval based strategy browsergame I started coding in highschool to learn php.
Stopped development in 2009.
Its not finished but basics should work (buildings, research etc.)

Project is based on 'kohana' php framework.
Unfortunately the database backup is lost but the structure can be reconstructed from the ORM-Model files (which will be hassle).

Hope it will be of use for somebody.
